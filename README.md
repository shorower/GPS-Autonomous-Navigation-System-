# GPS-Autonomous-Navigation-System


Project Name: GPS Autonomous Navigation System.

Components: 
NEO-M8 gps module, Compass, Motor, wheel, Motor driver, Battery, Microcontroller.


Description: 
That sounds like an exciting and challenging project! Building a functional autonomous car from scratch requires a diverse set of skills,                  including electrical engineering and coding. Before starting, develop a detailed plan that includes a list of necessary components, their                  specifications, and where to source them. 



Assembly :
Attach the motors to the chassis using screws or brackets. Make sure they are evenly spaced and aligned. Attach the wheels to the motors using              shafts or couplings. Connect the motor driver board to the motors and battery. Then, connect GPS & compass to the microcontroller. Program the              system using a microcontroller such as an Arduino or ESP32. 


Coding : 
Get all real-time data from the module. Calculate the values and find target heading and target distance. We use some mathematical method to get            target heading and target distance for calibrating our rover. 

If the rover's heading degree and calculated heading degree do not match, then the rover will turn left or turn right and calibrate heading. Then if the rover's heading degree and calculated heading degree are matched, then go forward until a distance less than 5 meters.
If the rover reaches a waypoint, then the rover will get ready to move to the next waypoint.

Conclusion: 
In conclusion, this project was a challenging but rewarding experience for the team. Our task was to build a functional GPS autonomous car from scratch, which required us to gather various components and assemble them together, and code the microcontroller.
